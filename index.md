### Desciption:

Today's lesson is mainly about understanding the student's role in the upcoming group study. During the lesson, Mr.Jonathan gave students a number of websites that allow students to choose from a number of options where, at the end of the lesson, the website will display the results of what the student is good at and provide a role as a hint. And Mr.Jonathan asked students to write their suggested roles on the whiteboard to compare with others and analyze them. Some other fun activities during class time were to describe ourselves in 3 words. At that time, my friends and I just gave some simple words to express personality such as enthusiasm, creative, and friendly.

### Feeling:

During class, I interacted with other students a lot to ask about their roles, 2 friends in my reasoning group, so I was very curious about their roles. After knowing their results, I feel very fortunate because they have good leadership skills so they can coordinate well with me in the division work. Studying with Mr.Jonathan really gives me chills and relaxation because he doesn't force or force anyone to do something.

### Action plan

After the class, my team researched some assignments for the assignment and prepared for the final deadline that would come at the end of the week. Once the group had completed the research assignment, I could see that I was not participating enough in the research, mainly because the other 2 members of the team were shouldering it. In the future, I will need to look for opportunities to sign up for extracurricular activities to practice teamwork and gain more experience in group conflict resolution.
